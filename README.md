This repository contains all files required to replicate this simple Line Follower Robot simulated in Webots.
The Bot and the tracks are custom made and files are included. The bot has 2 motor controlled wheels, one castor wheel and 3 IR Distance Sensors. The controller code has the logic to tell the bot which direction to turn based on the values received from the Distance sensors.
